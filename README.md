# ValueFlows economic resource coordination software: Holochain implementation
> Uses the [Resources, events, agents (REA) accounting model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_events,_agents_(accounting_model)), with an implementation based on the [ValueFlows](https://valueflo.ws/) protocol, and is built on [Holochain](https://holochain.org/)

## Repository structure

- `happs/` contains subdirectories corresponding to separate Holochain app DNA packages, which run as independent DHTs. These DNAs may contain multiple zomes but usually there is just one zome per DHT.
- `lib/` contains library code that is used by the various hApps (Holochain apps). Note that shared code is necessary to facilitate sharing of data between DHTs, as the de/serialisation logic is defined by Rust structs.
	- `vf-core/` is the ValueFlows system implemented in pure Rust. There are *no Holochain dependencies* in this module. All tests are implemented as standard Rust unit tests.
- `test/` contains JavaScript integration tests for the system as a whole&mdash; they cover zome API tests and interactions between different app DHTs.
- `scripts/` just has utility script files used for DevOps tasks and configuring the repo.
- Nodejs package commands in `package.json` at the top level of the repo are used to orchestrate test commands & run the apps for development.
